# Next.js E-Commerce with Android Capacitor

This repository contains a robust and scalable e-commerce application built with Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.

The application is designed with a mobile-first approach and is integrated with Android Capacitor, a cross-platform native runtime that allows us to build Android mobile apps using JavaScript and modern web technologies.

## Features
- **Next.js**: Enables efficient server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **E-Commerce Functionality**: Comprehensive e-commerce features including product listing, shopping cart, checkout process, and user authentication.
- **Android Capacitor**: Allows the web application to be packaged as a native Android app, providing a seamless mobile experience.

## Getting Started
Instructions for setting up the development environment, running the application, and building the Android app are provided in the README.
